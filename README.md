# k8s-sock-shop-deploy
Modified K8S deploy file for microservices demo for compatibility with new API.  Replaced deprecated extensions/v1beta1 with apps/v1 and added labels/selectors as necessary.  Tested on v1.16. 

Clone the repo:
https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo/

Then replace deploy/kubernetes/complete-demo.yaml with this one.
